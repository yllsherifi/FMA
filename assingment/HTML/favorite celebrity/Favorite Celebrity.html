                    Sinatra began singing professionally as a teenager. Even though he never learned to read music, he
                    learned by ear.[48][49] He got his first break in 1935 when his mother persuaded a local singing group
                    called the 3 Flashes to let him join. Baritone Fred Tamburro stated that "Frank hung around us like we
                    were gods or something", admitting that they only took him on board because he owned a car[g] and could
                    chauffeur the group around. Sinatra soon learned they were auditioning for the Major Bowes Amateur Hour
                    show and "begged" the group to let him in on the act.[51]
